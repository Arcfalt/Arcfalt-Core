# Arcfalt-Core
Arcfalt-Core is a bunch of experimental things I've made for fun in TSWoW. This project is not affiliated with TSWoW in any way, nor is it made for any server project out there. *(Although if you like any of this stuff, feel free to use it!)* I just enjoy modding and playing around with making things in a setting I love.

## Installation
1. Use the TSWoW installation guide: [TSWoW Wiki](https://tswow.github.io/tswow-wiki/home/) 
2. After TSWoW is installed, put this into your modules/ folder as 'arcfalt-core'.
3. Finally, run `build all` to assure all parts are correctly built.

## Important Note
Currently the modules contained here aren't very well seperated from each other, since I didn't initially create them to be seperate. I do plan to one day make them less connected so you can easily only use the specific ones you're interested in, but for now you may need to manually delete and tweak a few things to remove parts if you don't want everything.

## Current Modules
* **raceClasses**: Unlocks every class for every race. This is not a simple 'just enable the classes and call it a day' module, this fixes all associated racial abilities, such as creating a rage version of blood elves' arcane torrent, and adds full class trainers and class quests for all combinations that were previously not available, with fully baked npc's with guard gossip directions and everything that would be expected of a vanilla selectable class. Currently work in progress, with some class combinations more complete thatn others.

* **classicZones**: Attempts to partially revert some areas back to a closer feel to what they were before they were changed in WotLK, such as changing mobs back to their original positions and general visuals, without removing the *intent* of some changes such as less amounts to kill in certain quests. Things like starter zones and Undercity that had significant thematic changes in late WotLK.

* **tmogs**: Adds transmogrifier npc's in capital cities. Themed as engineer gnomes/goblin technicians managing a T-MOG robot. Guard gossip options included.

* **classicFixes**: Fixes assorted little npc text and trainer issues that I've stumbled across in trinity core.
